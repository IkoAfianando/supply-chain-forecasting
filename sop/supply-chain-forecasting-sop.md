## Decision Tree Processes

### Material Procurement Decision Process

```
START: Material Need Identified
├── Current Inventory > 30-day forecast?
│   ├── YES → Check expiration dates → Monitor only
│   └── NO → Continue to procurement evaluation
│
├── Lead time + delivery time > remaining stock days?
│   ├── YES → URGENT: Initiate emergency procurement
│   └── NO → Continue to standard procurement
│
├── Supplier performance score > 8.0?
│   ├── YES → Use primary supplier
│   └── NO → Evaluate secondary suppliers
│
├── Order quantity meets EOQ optimization?
│   ├── YES → Generate purchase order
│   └── NO → Adjust quantity or delay order
│
END: Procurement decision executed
```

### Quality Hold Response Process

```
START: Quality Issue Identified
├── Critical path material affected?
│   ├── YES → Initiate emergency supplier contact
│   └── NO → Standard quality resolution process
│
├── Alternative material available in inventory?
│   ├── YES → Issue material substitution order
│   └── NO → Expedite replacement material order
│
├── Production schedule impact > 24 hours?
│   ├── YES → Notify customer of potential delay
│   └── NO → Continue standard operations
│
END: Quality issue resolved
```

### Seasonal Demand Adjustment Process

```
START: Monthly Demand Review
├── Historical seasonal pattern detected?
│   ├── YES → Apply seasonal adjustment factors
│   └── NO → Use standard forecasting model
│
├── Q3 infrastructure spike period (Jul-Sep)?
│   ├── YES → Increase steel coil inventory by 40%
│   └── NO → Use standard inventory targets
│
├── Holiday/shutdown periods approaching?
│   ├── YES → Build pre-shutdown inventory buffer
│   └── NO → Maintain standard operations
│
END: Seasonal adjustments applied
```
