## Key Findings from Data Analysis

### Available Data Sources (MongoDB Collections)
- **Orders**: 2,673 historical jobs + 34 active orders
- **Parts**: 8,678 product specifications with tonnage data
- **Production Timing**: 125K+ timer logs for lead time calculations
- **Equipment**: 44-57 machine records for capacity planning

### Identified Material Patterns
- **Steel Consumption**: 5.716 - 8.574 tons per Box Culvert unit
- **Product Variations**: Multiple wall thickness and size configurations
- **Manufacturing Standards**: C1577 specification compliance

### Critical Missing Data (Requiring Placeholders)
1. Supplier lead times and performance metrics
2. Current inventory levels and reorder points
3. Customer segmentation (Contractors/Oil & Gas/Infrastructure)
4. Financial parameters (carrying costs, procurement costs)

## Business Logic Framework

### Seasonal Demand Patterns
- **Q3 Infrastructure Spike**: +40% demand increase (July-September)
- **Oil & Gas Seasonality**: Q1 peak (+20%), Q3 decline (-20%)
- **Contractor Patterns**: Steady with Q2/Q3 increases

### Material Procurement Strategy
- **Steel Coils**: 4-6 week lead times, 60% Q3 pre-buildup
- **Welding Consumables**: 2-3 week lead times, 80% Q3 pre-buildup  
- **Coating Materials**: 1-2 week lead times, just-in-time with Q3 buffer

### Risk Mitigation Approach
- Cross-analysis prevention through multi-source demand signals
- Overstock reduction via inventory turnover optimization
- Shortage prevention through predictive reorder point management
