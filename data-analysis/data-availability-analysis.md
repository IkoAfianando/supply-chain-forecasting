   - Supplier pricing history
   - Geographic location of suppliers

2. **Material Classifications**
   - Steel coils specifications
   - Welding consumables types
   - Coating materials categories
   - Raw material vs finished goods classification

3. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Contractors vs Oil & Gas vs Infrastructure classification
   - Customer demand seasonality
   - Geographic distribution
   - Order size patterns by customer type

4. **Inventory Metrics**
   - Current stock levels
   - Safety stock requirements
   - Reorder points
   - Economic order quantities

5. **Financial Data**
   - Material costs
   - Carrying costs
   - Shortage costs
   - Transportation costs

### Seasonal Pattern Indicators

#### Available Temporal Data
